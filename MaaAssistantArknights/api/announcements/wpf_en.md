### Stopped automatic resource updates

Automatic resource version updates are now stopped. For manual updates, go to `Settings`-`Update` and click `Resource Update`. If you cannot update for a long time or fail frequently, please refer to [link](https://github.com/MaaAssistantArknights/MaaAssistantArknights/issues/10033).

The format of the resource version number is `Current Activity Name/Banner Name` + `#Update Date`. Since events are usually divided into two halves, the minimum requirement for the version number should at least match the date of the level update.

**The resource versions is relatively independent of the software versions. Updating the resource file has limited capabilities and cannot fix bugs in the software core or add new features. For details on version updates, please refer to the changelog.**

Currently, MAA has only suspended the automatic update of the resource files, but the software core updates are still in progress. Each version update includes resource updates, so the resources are not completely static.

If the resource version lags behind, it may affect the automatic combat of new levels, drop recognition and new tags and operator recognition in recruitment. If you do not rely on these features, you can choose to wait for a new MAA version to be updated.
